## Overview

This repository provides a fully reproducible pipeline for generating the Center for Metropolitan Studies ([CEM](https://centrodametropole.fflch.usp.br/)) logo pattern, based on its [20-Year Commemorative Logo](images/logo-cem-20.png).

The pipeline report is available [here](https://cem-usp.github.io/logo-pattern/).

## Usage

The pipeline was developed using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system and the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). To ensure consistent results, the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package is used to manage and restore the R environment.

After installing the three dependencies mentioned above, follow these steps to reproduce the analyses:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open** the project in your preferred IDE.
3. **Restore the R environment** by running [`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/restore.html) in the R console. This will install all required software dependencies.
4. **Open** `index.qmd` and run the code as described in the report.
